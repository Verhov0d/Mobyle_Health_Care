## üì± Application Overview

This mobile application is a **Functional State and Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** developed for Android. It allows users to input personal physiological parameters and receive health-related metrics with interpretation and recommendations.

The app is designed for students, athletes, or anyone interested in assessing their physical condition through scientifically-based formulas.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Function Descriptions

The app consists of **8 core modules**, each corresponding to a specific health metric:

1. **BMI Calculator**
   - Calculates Body Mass Index based on height and weight.
   - Determines if body weight is within normal range, underweight, or overweight.

2. **Physical Activity Level**
   - Analyzes daily steps.
   - Categorizes lifestyle: sedentary, moderately active, active, or very active.

3. **Endurance Coefficient**
   - Evaluates cardiovascular endurance using heart rate and blood pressure.
   - Reflects the condition of the circulatory system.

4. **Cardiovascular Regulation Index (Robinson‚Äôs Index)**
   - Assesses heart workload and oxygen demand.
   - Indicates the efficiency of heart regulation at rest.

5. **Vital Index**
   - Computes lung capacity relative to body weight.
   - Assesses respiratory system functionality.

6. **Skibinski Index**
   - Combines lung volume, breath-holding (Stange test), and heart rate.
   - Measures overall endurance of respiratory and cardiovascular systems.

7. **Kerdo Autonomic Index**
   - Determines the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity.
   - Reflects the level of autonomic regulation.

8. **Functional Changes Index**
   - A composite formula using age, height, weight, and blood pressure.
   - Estimates the body‚Äôs cardiovascular adaptability and functional reserve.
